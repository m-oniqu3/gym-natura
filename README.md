Natura is a fictional women-only gym that was founded with the goal of providing a safe and welcoming environment for women to pursue their fitness goals. They saw how many women felt uncomfortable in traditional gyms, and they wanted to create a space where women could feel safe and supported while working on their health and fitness goals.

## Motivation

I wanted to build a website for a women only gym to practice my skills with React and to put my design skills to the test. I think it's important for women to have their own space to work out and feel comfortable, and I wanted to create a website that would reflect that.

I wanted to create something unique that would grab attention and be visually appealing.I am motivated by my desire to learn and create something not only useful but also beautiful, hence the creation of this website.

Natura was build using:

- React
- React Router Dom & React Router HashLink
